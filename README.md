# Color Conversion
## AIM
To perform the color conversion between RGB, BGR, HSV, and YCbCr color models.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## Algorithm:
### Step1:
<br>

### Step2:
<br>

### Step3:
<br>

### Step4:
<br>

### Step5:
<br>

## Program:
```python
# Developed By:
# Register Number:
# i) Convert BGR and RGB to HSV and GRAY





# ii)Convert HSV to RGB and BGR





# iii)Convert RGB and BGR to YCrCb




# iv)Split and Merge RGB Image




# v) Split and merge HSV Image




```
## Output:
### i) BGR and RGB to HSV and GRAY
<br>
<br>

### ii) HSV to RGB and BGR
<br>
<br>

### iii) RGB and BGR to YCrCb
<br>
<br>

### iv) Split and merge RGB Image
<br>
<br>

### v) Split and merge HSV Image
<br>
<br>


## Result:
Thus the color conversion was performed between RGB, HSV and YCbCr color models.
